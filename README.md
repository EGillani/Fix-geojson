# Fix-geojson

I ended up having an issue where I couldnt get a json response (in geojson format) to be viewed correctly whether I was trying to read it in QGIS or read it in an html page that used openstreetmap. I researched geojson format guidelines and finally resolved the issue, but since it was the standard response from an API. I had to create a script to fix it each time I made an API request.
